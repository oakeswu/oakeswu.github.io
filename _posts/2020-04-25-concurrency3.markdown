# Runnable源码分析
```
public interface Runnable {
    /**
     * When an object implementing interface <code>Runnable</code> is used
     * to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object's
     * <code>run</code> method to be called in that separately executing
     * thread.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of the method <code>run</code> is that it may
     * take any action whatsoever.
     *
     * @see     java.lang.Thread#run()
     */
    public abstract void run();
}
```
可以看出Runnable只有一个run()方法

# Thread（简化）
```
public class Thread implements Runnable {
    private volatile String name;
    private int            priority;
    private boolean     daemon = false;
    private Runnable target;
    /**
     * Returns a reference to the currently executing thread object.
     *
     * @return  the currently executing thread.
     */
    public static native Thread currentThread();
    public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException
    public static void sleep(long millis, int nanos)
    throws InterruptedException {
        if (millis < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
        }

        if (nanos < 0 || nanos > 999999) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                                "nanosecond timeout value out of range");
        }

        if (nanos >= 500000 || (nanos != 0 && millis == 0)) {
            millis++;
        }

        sleep(millis);
    }

    public Thread() {
        init(null, null, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
    }
    public Thread(Runnable target) {
        init(null, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
    }
    public Thread(Runnable target, String name) {
        init(null, target, name, 0);
    }

    /**

        if (threadStatus != 0)
            throw new IllegalThreadStateException();

        /* Notify the group that this thread is about to be started
         * so that it can be added to the group's list of threads

        boolean started = false;
        try {

        } finally {
            try {
                if (!started) {
                    group.threadStartFailed(this);

    @Override
    public void run() {
        if (target != null) {

```
上面是Thread的简化源码，我们可以看到直接上Thread就是继承的Runnable，Thread的start方法其实最终执行的仍然是run方法。
